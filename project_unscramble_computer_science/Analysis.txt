---------- Run Time Analysis -----------

TASK 0:
O(1)
The run time is constant because accessing an element in an array is O(1).
Since we are getting first and last elements of tuple, we know the indexes upfront. So the time complexity is constant.

TASK 1:
O(m+n)
m - number of records in calls excel
n - number of records in texts excel

I mentioned time complexity as m+n because the size of texts tuple and calls tuple can be different. If both texts tuple
and calls tuple have same size all the time then time complexity will be O(n). Both O(m+n) and O(n) means the complexity
is linear.

TASK 2:
O(n)
n - number of records in calls excel
The time complexity is linear to input size.

TASK 3:
Part A - O(nlogn) - n is the number of unique records in the input. The worst case for sorting algorithm is nlogn
Part B - O(n) -  Time complexity is linear to input size.
n - number of records

Task 4:
O(nlogn) - n is the number of unique records in the input. The worst case for sorting algorithm is nlogn
n - size of input
